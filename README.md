# Automated Development Environment

This project includes a fully automated development environment setup that handles MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist management, backend and frontend services, and more.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get everything up and running with a single command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Set up MongoDB Atlas credentials
3. Update your IP in MongoDB Atlas
4. Configure auto-startup (optional)
5. Start all services (optional)

## üìã Available Commands

### One-Command Solutions

- `npm run setup` - Complete automated setup
- `npm run start-all-windows` - Start all services in separate windows
- `npm run start-all` - Start all services in one terminal

### MongoDB Atlas IP Management

- `npm run update-mongo-ip` - Update your IP in MongoDB Atlas once
- `npm run auto-update-ip` - Start daemon to keep your IP updated automatically

### Services

- `npm run frontend` - Start frontend server
- `npm run backend` - Start backend server
- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend

### Automation

- `npm run configure-auto-startup` - Set up services to start automatically at login
- `npm run install-all` - Install all dependencies

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Automated IP Management

The system automatically:
1. Detects your current public IP address
2. Checks if it has changed since last run
3. Updates MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist via their API
4. Keeps track of your last known IP

### Multi-Service Startup

- Each service runs in its own window for easier debugging
- IP updater runs in the background checking for changes every 15 minutes
- Updates happen automatically without interrupting your workflow

## üîë Credentials

MongoDB Atlas credentials are securely stored in your `.env` file. If you need to update them:

1. Edit the `backend/.env` file
2. Update these values:
   ```
   MONGODB_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   MONGODB_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   MONGODB_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

- Check log files in `Scripts/ip-daemon.log` and `Scripts/ip-update.log`
- If services don't start, make sure all dependencies are installed
- For MongoDB connection issues, check your IP in the Atlas dashboard
